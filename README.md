### Background
I got the idea to make this program when my step-son recieved the Rush Hour game for his birthday. I just got some practice in graph traversal and search algorithms from a recent class, so I wanted to see if I could find a reasonable solution.
The code was written entirely by me. The concepts were learned in the CS50-AI class.
Chat-GPT was used very minimally to help brainstorm and troubleshoot, especially for finding a way to optimize the final script. No code was generated by AI.

The most computationally expensive step was the function that checks previously explored/ "seen" states, or board positions. This is necessary to make sure you don't go into an infinite loop (moving a car back and forth forever, for example).
Two optimizations I made were:
1 - changing the explored object from a list of arrays to a set of byte strings. This changed search time from O(N) to O(1).
2 - changing the checker function from an "all" boolean comparison `np.all(array_a, array_b)` to a byte string search in the set `array.tobytes() in memo`.
These changes made the script run about 99% faster. Before the changes, the most difficult problem took ~2 mins to solve, whereas afterwards, it took about 1.7 seconds.
